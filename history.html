    <img src = "batik.jpg" width = "200" height = "200" ><br>
    <p>Batik making in the Ghanaian society is typically run by females in a family. <br>
        The mother teaches her child the skill and it is passed on from generation to generation.<br>
        It is also practiced in Indonesia and some other Asian countires. Some suggest there may be a connection.
